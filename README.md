# GifTastic

This is a link to the giphy API. In order to use the program simply click one of the pre-loaded buttons to load 10 gifs on the subject. Not good enough for you. Generate your own button by typing it in the search bar. Once done the button you want will join the rest of the buttons up top. Simply click it and get what you want to see. Enjoy the animation, by clicking each of the gifs, to stop just click one more time!. Please enjoy and let me know how you like it or if there is something you think would improve it, thanks!
